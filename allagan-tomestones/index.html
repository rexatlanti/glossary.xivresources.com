<h1>Allagan Tomestones</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>| noun | 1. Refers to the various currencies called &ldquo;Allagan tomestones of [noun]&rdquo; used primarily to purchase equipment. There are two types of tomestones for the max-level equipment; one has a weekly cap on how many you can earn, and the other does not. The tomestones with the weekly cap are used exclusively to purchase the most recent, highest item level tomestone equipment. The uncapped tomestones are used to purchase previous, lower item level tiers of tomestone gear, as well as various materials used for high level crafting. All the tomestone vendors from previous expansions deal in the third variety of tomestone, which also has no weekly cap. Note: it&rsquo;s &ldquo;tomestone,&rdquo; not &ldquo;tombstone&rdquo;; they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;tomes,&rdquo; like a book. Lore-wise, they&rsquo;re small, vaguely rectangular bits of rock/metal that contain huge quantities of information, created by an ancient, technologically advanced civilization. Hence, &ldquo;tome-stone.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re literally fantasy flash drives. The more you know&mldr; |</p>
