---
| noun | 1.  	A-rank Hunt marks are special overworld enemies that take 3-4 hours to respawn. Each overworld zone has either one or two A-rank Hunt marks that are unique to that zone. They are designed to be challenged by 8+ players at the same level as the monster. Participants receive gil, various tomestones, and hunt currency in amounts corresponding to the three tiers of participation credit, similar to a FATE.	|
