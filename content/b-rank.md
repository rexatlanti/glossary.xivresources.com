title: B-Rank
---
| noun | 1.  	B-rank Hunt marks are special overworld enemies that, unlike A-ranks, are designed to be soloable by a player at the same level (though it may not be easy, depending on your job and gear level; a healer chocobo companion may be desired). Each zone has one or two B-ranks unique to that zone, and they respawn in another location in the zone a few seconds after being defeated. These marks do not offer any rewards unless you have a bounty for that specific mark. You may obtain one random B-rank bounty once a week from each of the Hunt boards (one for each level range/expansion).	|
