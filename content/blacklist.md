title: Blacklist
---
| noun | 1.  	Adding a character to your blacklist prevents you from seeing their chat messages and prevents them from interacting with you in most ways, including trade requests, inviting you to parties, joining Party Finder groups hosted by you, etc. There are some limits, however: your blacklist is unavailable and does not function inside instanced duties, and automated matchmaking does not take your blacklist into consideration. Though unlikely, it is still possible to be matched with them through Duty Finder, and if you end up inside an instance together, their chat messages will not be hidden. Similarly, they could join a Party Finder group that you're in if it's hosted by someone who does not have them blacklisted.	|
