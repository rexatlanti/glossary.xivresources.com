title: Chains/Thorns/Brambles
---
| noun | 1.  	A mechanic that connects pairs of players with thorny vines or glowing, red chains, usually dealing damage over time to both players. Must be broken by both players moving away from each other. Note: it is not based on positioning or distance alone, but rather the movement of both players. If one player does not move, they will generally not break. If the tethered players are extremely far apart to begin with, they may not have enough room in the arena to increase the distance between them enough to break the tether without first moving closer to each other.	|
