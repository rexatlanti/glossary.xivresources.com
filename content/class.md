title: Class
---
| noun | 1.  	A class is the precursor to a job. At level 30, you receive your job stone from a quest, and once equipped, your class is replaced with the associated job. You should always have a job stone equipped from level 30 onward. The existence of base classes is a relic of 1.0 which they have been unable to completely remove from the original jobs, but newly released jobs, from Heavensward (3.0) onward, have no associated base class. The only notable relevance of the class system is that Scholar and Summoner share a base class: Arcanist. This means that they actually share levels.	|
