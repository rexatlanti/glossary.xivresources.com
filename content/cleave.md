title: Cleave
---
| noun | 1.  An attack that affects all targets in an area in front of (or sometimes to the side of) the attacker. Usually refers to frontal cone attacks that are directed at the current tank, which will damage any other players who are in the (untelegraphed) cleave area. Many enemy types have untelegraphed cleaves with no cast bar, or have basic attacks that always cleave, so when in doubt, it is unwise to stand in front of the boss if you are not a tank. 

| noun | 2.  "Cleave" is also sometimes used to refer more broadly to dealing damage to multiple targets at once, usually without switching entirely to an AoE rotation. Examples include applying DoTs to two targets while maintaining a single target rotation, or hitting multiple targets with certain AoE attacks that are part of a normal single target rotation.	|
