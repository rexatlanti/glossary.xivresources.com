title: Dragoon
---
| noun | 1.  	A classic Final Fantasy job, the Dragoon is a polearm-wielding melee DPS famous for its flashy "jump" and "dive" attacks. Also the subject of many a friendly "floor tanking" joke, resulting from their backflip skill and the sometimes unforgiving animation locks on the aforementioned jump and dive attacks. Its associated base class is Lancer (LNC).	|
