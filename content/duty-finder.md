title: Duty Finder
---
| noun | 1.  	The system used to register/queue for most instanced duties. If you register with an incomplete party, it uses matchmaking to assemble a full group, but it is also the system you use to enter most instanced duties with a full party. Not to be confused with Raid Finder, which is used for the current high-end duties that are not part of the Duty Finder.	|
