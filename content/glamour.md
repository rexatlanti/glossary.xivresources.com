title: Glamour
---
| noun | 1.  	The glamour system allows you to change the appearance of your equipment into that of another piece of equipment, traditionally by using easily acquired consumables called "glamour prisms." The altered appearance of your equipment is also referred to as "a glamour." The glamour dresser allows you to store and retrieve equipment for use in "glamour plates," which are configurable appearance presets that can be repeatedly applied to your equipped gear without carrying the appearance items around or consuming additional glamour prisms.	|
