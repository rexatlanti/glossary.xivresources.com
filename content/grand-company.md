title: Grand Company
---
| noun | 1.  	Refers to the military organizations of each of the starting city-states. The player chooses to join one of them early on in the Main Scenario Quest progression. The choice has no mechanical bearing on gameplay, and you may change to another Grand Company any number of times in the future, with a lengthy cooldown period in between. Most players decide based on lore or fashion, as one of the only differences between them is the appearance of the glamour gear sets that are available from each Grand Company. These pieces of gear can only be worn or used for glamour if you are currently affiliated with the corresponding Grand Company.	|
