title: Hardcore
---
| noun | 1.  	An extreme level of dedication to something, often in a competitive sense, and often involving a massive time investment. For instance, it's not uncommon for "hardcore raiding" to involve playing 12-16 hours per day when a new raid releases, either in the race to be the first group to complete the encounters, or simply in an attempt to complete all the encounters during the first weekly lockout period. "Hardcore crafting" may involve a similar level of commitment to mastering the newest recipes as quickly as possible to capitalize on early sales, or simply extreme dedication to crafting in general.	|
