title: Healer
---
| noun | 1.  	One of the "trinity" roles in FFXIV. Recognizable by their green job icons, healers require the broadest definition of their responsibilities: to contribute as much as possible to the success of the party. The first point on that list is keeping the party alive, but simply keeping everyone alive doesn't require casting heals at all times, or even most of the time. Thus, healers in this game often find themselves spending much of their time dealing damage when healing is not required. This is an integral part of playing a healer, because when the healing requirements have been met, it's the only way you have left to continue to contribute to the success of the party.	|
