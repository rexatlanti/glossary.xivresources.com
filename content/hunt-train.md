title: Hunt Train
---
| noun | 1.  	A large group of players, typically organized through Hunt-focused linkshells or Discord servers, in order to travel through all the zones of an expansion and systematically defeat all the A-rank marks in that expansion. This generally keeps the respawn timers close together, allowing hunt trains to very consistently make clean sweeps whenever the respawn timer is finished.	|
