title: Job
---
| noun | 1.  	In most games, this would be the equivalent of a "class." In FFXIV, a job is what a base class evolves into, and "class" refers specifically to the half-formed base of the job before you got your job stone. For example, White Mage is a job, and the half-baked class underneath it is Conjurer. Jobs released from Heavensward (3.0) onward simply start as a job, and they do not have any associated base class.	|
