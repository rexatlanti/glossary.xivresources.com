title: Party Finder
---
| noun | 1.  	A system used to post, browse, and join listings for actively recruiting parties, with the ability to designate the content the party is doing and impose requirements for joining, such as an item level requirement, or only accepting specific roles or jobs. Contentiously, it is also often used for advertising a variety of things, rather than actually recruiting for an active party. 	|
