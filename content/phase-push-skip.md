title: Push/Skip
---
| noun | 1.  	The timing of a phase transition can sometimes be deliberately manipulated, depending on the trigger, such as the completion of certain mechanics, boss HP thresholds, etc. 

To "push [the phase]" is to force a phase transition faster than usual, especially in cases where doing so cuts the boss's current rotation short, thereby skipping the remaining attacks/mechanics of the previous phase. 

There are some extreme cases in which forcing a phase transition early enough can cause the boss to skip its entire next phase, transitioning directly from phase one to phase three, for example. In some cases, it is advantageous to deliberately manipulate the timing of a phase transition, either delaying or rushing it. 

Typically, faster is preferred, but there are some niche exceptions in which an early transition can cause upcoming mechanics to overlap in undesirable ways.	|
