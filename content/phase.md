title: Phase
---
| noun | 1.  	Boss encounters are often separated into different sections called "phases," with each phase containing different mechanics or events. These separations are sometimes arbitrarily defined by players, but many bosses do have explicitly separated phases with obvious transitions. Transitioning to the next phase is also called "phasing," as in "the boss is phasing," or "we need to phase [the boss]."	|
