title: Scholar
---
| noun | 1.  	A healer characterized by its use of shields (HP barriers), its healing pet (the fairy), and Aetherflow management. Its base class is Arcanist (ACN), which is a DPS. This is the only instance in the game where one base class branches into two different jobs, which can be confusing, because going from Arcanist to Scholar completely changes your role from DPS to healer.	|
