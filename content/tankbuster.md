title: Tankbuster
---
| noun | 1.  	An attack that deals high damage to the tank(s), which is sometimes enough to kill a tank outright, or close to it, if it is not properly mitigated. Almost every boss in the game has some kind of tankbuster that is used multiple times throughout the encounter, and some hit harder than others.	|
