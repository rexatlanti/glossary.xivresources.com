title: The Hunt
---
| noun | 1.  	The Hunt is a type of content in which players receive rewards for finding and defeating special overworld enemies. Each overworld zone has one or two A-rank and B-rank marks, as well as one S-rank mark, that are unique to that zone. A-rank and S-rank Hunt marks offer rewards to all participants in amounts corresponding to the three tiers of participation credit, similar to FATEs. These rewards include gil, tomestones, and various hunt currencies, corresponding to the expansion the mark is from (ARR zones, HW zones, etc). Those hunt currencies can be exchanged for a wide variety of rewards, such as glamour gear, mounts, minions, orchestrion rolls, materia, emotes, and items used to upgrade equipment purchased with tomestones.	|
