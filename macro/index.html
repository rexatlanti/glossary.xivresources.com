<h1>Macro</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>| noun | 1. A macro is a user-created button that contains up to 15 lines of commands, which the game will attempt perform from top to bottom when the macro is executed. Macros can be used for many things, such as switching hotbar layouts, sending chat messages, changing game settings at the press of a button, and much more.</p>
<p>Macros are often used to partially automate crafting by executing a series of crafting actions in a predetermined order, greatly reducing the number of required inputs. Only one macro can be running at a time.</p>
<p>Notably, macros cannot utilize the skill queueing system, which allows for the seamless execution of actions by largely eliminating latency- and input-related delays between actions. For this reason, using them for combat actions can be clunky at best, and cause increased delays between actions at worst.</p>
<p>There are some niche exceptions in which macros may be worthwhile for certain combat actions. |</p>
